# OpenRGB-SDK

An SDK client for the RGB Software [OpenRGB](https://gitlab.com/CalcProgrammer1/OpenRGB/)

It based on the, already written, but apparently abandoned, [openrgb](https://github.com/vlakreeh/openrgb) library by vlakreeh and the [python](https://github.com/jath03/openrgb-python) implementation by jath03.

It is still under heavy development, poorly written and inconvenient to use, but since I'll probably forget this project in the next 5 seconds, I wanted, to make this accessible for later generations of confused people.

# Installation
